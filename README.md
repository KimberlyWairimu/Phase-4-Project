# Phase-4-Project
## Introduction
Pneumonia is an infection that causes inflammation in one or both of the lungs and may be caused by a virus,bacteria,fungi or other germs.When pneumonia is suspected, a chest X_ray is often recommended as part of the diagnostic process.
A chest X-ray helps the doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the exact location of the infection.X-ray images helps to confirms the presence of pneumonia by showing areas of opacity in the lungs,which are indicative of inflammation.
In the X-ray image, pneumonia is often seen as a white or gray patch(or patches),which represents the area of the lung affected by pneumonia. The rest of the lung appears darker on the X-ray image.The contrast allows the doctor to identify areas of pneumonia.However, while X-rays are a valuable tool in diagnosing pneumonia,they do have limitations.For instance, it's often difficult to diagnose pneumoia in people with pre-existing lung diseases since their lungs may already show abnormalities on the X-ray.Due to some of this limitations in diagnosing the presence of pnemonia, the Radiology department in conjuction with the Health Information Department(HIM) department from Kenyatta National Hospital have seen the need to employ deep learning to help them build a neural network that may help in the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Kenyatta National Hospital, located in Nairobi,Kenya is the largest public tertiary,referral hospital in the country.It holds about 1800 beds in the public wing and 209 beds in the private wing.The Radiology team in Kenyatta National Hospital(KNH) is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment.The department offers various specialized services to both adults and children,which include CT Scans,MRI(with sedation and anaesthesia), Ultrasound and Interventional Radiology.They carry out both non-vascular and vascular procedures such as image guided biopsies of the lungs among others.
On the other hand, the Health Information Management(HIM)department is responsible for collection, analysis and the protection of digital and traditional medical information vital to providing quality patient care.They ensure that data is properly stored, cleaned and made available for use.They also play a cricial role in ensuring that all data management practices comply with the various legal and ethical standards which includes things like patients privacy laws and regulation related to the storage of medical data.
The collaboration of this two departments is crucial in the effective running of KNH since the Radiology department generates vast amounts of data from various imaging procedures. This data needs to be properly managed to ensure it can be easily accessed and used by healthcare providers and this where the HIM Department comes in.

This project aims to develop a neural network model for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-rays images inorder to help the radiologist and other healthcare providers in Kenyatta National Hospital to make more accurate diagnoses by identifying patterns in X-ray images that may be difficult for humans to detect.By providing preliminary diagnosis,the model can save radiologists time,allowing them to focus on more complex cases, faster and more accurate diagnosis means that patients can receive treatment sooner,potentially leading to better outcomes.


## The Problem Statement
Pneumonia is a common lung infection caused by bacteria, a virus or fungi.It is a major cause of death among all age groups resulting in 2.56 million deaths worldwide in 2017. The diagnosis of pneumonia involves a physical exam followed by a chest X-ray. However, the interpretation of chest X-rays requires expert knowledge and can be time consuming.Morever, the accuracy of diagnosis can vary based on the experience and expertise of the radiologist.Since false diagnosis of pneumonia can lead to escalated medical conditions,increased risk of infection and incorect treatment,this has possed a problem to the KNH radiology team therefore, a need for an automated, reliable and efficient method to interpret chest X-rays and diagnose pneumonia.
This project aims to develop a neural network model that can accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-rays images,thereby assisting radiologists in Kenyatta National Hospital in diagnosis,reducing the time taken for diagnosis and ultimately leading to timely treatment and improved patient outcomes.
